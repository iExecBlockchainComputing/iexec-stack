    "Nerdalize is a Netherlands-based startup whose goal is to eventually move away from traditional and centralized data centers. The companyâ€™s innovation is to place servers directly in residential homes and recycle the energy that dissipates from these servers into heating water. This process results in a reduced heating bill for homeowners, while removing the cost of setting up a traditional data center.",
