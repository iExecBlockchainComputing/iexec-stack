              <SPAN lang="en-us">Normal web traffic is sent unencrypted over the Internet. That is,
              anyone with access to the right tools can snoop all of that traffic. Obviously, this
              can lead to problems, especially where security and privacy is necessary, such as in
              credit card data and bank transactions. The Secure Socket Layer is used to encrypt
              the data stream between the web server and the web client (the browser).</SPAN>

            <P>
              <SPAN lang="en-us">SSL makes use of what is known as <B>asymmetric cryptography</B>,
              commonly referred to as <B>public key cryptography (PKI)</B>. With public key
              cryptography, two keys are created, one public, one private. Anything encrypted with
              either key can only be decrypted with its corresponding key. Thus if a message or
              data stream were encrypted with the server's private key, it can be decrypted only
              using its corresponding public key, ensuring that the data only could have come from
              the server.</SPAN>
            </P>
            <P>
              <SPAN lang="en-us">If SSL utilizes public key cryptography to encrypt the data stream
              traveling over the Internet, why is a certificate necessary? The technical answer to
              that question is that a certificate is not really necessary</SPAN> - <SPAN lang=
              "en-us">the data is secure and cannot easily be decrypted by a third party. However,
              certificates do serve a crucial role in the communication process. The certificate,
              signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), ensures that the certificate holder
              is really who he claims to be. Without a trusted signed certificate, your data may be
              encrypted, however, the party you are communicating with may not be whom you think.
              Without certificates, impersonation attacks would be much more common.</SPAN>

              Once the private key is generated a Certificate Signing Request can be generated. The
              CSR is then used in one of two ways. Ideally, the CSR will be sent to a Certificate

              will be for "Common Name (e.g., YOUR name)". It is important that this field be
              filled in with the fully qualified domain name of the server to be protected by SSL.

            Step 3: Remove Passphrase from Key
          </P>
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P class="normal">
              One unfortunate side-effect of the pass-phrased private key is <B>that Apache will
              ask for the pass-phrase each time the web server is started</B>. Obviously this is
              not necessarily convenient as someone will not always be around to type in the
              pass-phrase, such as after a reboot or crash. mod_ssl includes the ability to use an
              external program in place of the built-in pass-phrase dialog, however, this is not
              necessarily the most secure option either. <B>It is possible to remove the Triple-DES
              encryption from the key</B>, thereby no longer needing to type in a pass-phrase. If
              the private key is no longer encrypted, it is critical that this file only be
              readable by the root user! If your system is ever compromised and a third party
              obtains your unencrypted private key, the corresponding certificate will need to be
              revoked. With that being said, use the following command to remove the pass-phrase
              from the key:

            <P>
              At this point you will need to generate a self-signed certificate because you either
              don't plan on having your certificate signed by a CA, or you wish to test your new
              SSL implementation while the CA is signing your certificate. This temporary
              certificate will generate an error in the client browser to the effect that the
              signing certificate authority is unknown and not trusted.
            </P>
