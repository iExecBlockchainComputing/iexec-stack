# Next defines server keystore URI
# When to use : before your server keys exprire
# How to use :
# -1- generate new keystore containing both actual and next server public keys
# -2- store the keystore in XWHEP data reposiroty using xwsenddata
# -3- keep the data URI
# -4- set next variable with the data URI
#
# This does not break security since
# -a- workers and clients must have the current server public key to connect to server
# -b- new keystore is then distributed through encrypted communication channel
# -c- workers and clients must have valid credentials to connect to server
# -d- workers and clients safely keep keystores
# -e- distributed keystore contains server public keys only
#
#KEYSTOREURI=xw://blabla
 

# This sets the alive period : the period between two 'alive' signal
# from workers
#
# This value is sent to worker at connection time; workers conform to it
#
# This helps to determine whether the worker is still computing...
# If the signal is not received after 3 times this period, workers are
# considered lost and jobs running on this worker are reinserted in the
# scheduler queue
#
# Don't use a two small value if you don't want to fullfill the server bandwidth
# You should definitively keep the default value, or greater
#
# Default : 300 (5mn)

# You can set here the list of modules you wish to have a log.
# Existing modules are DBI, Comm, Task.

#
# Following are two ACL variables
# They must contains regular expression (regexp)
#
# Regexp examples
#  - accept all incoming connection                : .*
#  - accept incoming connection from '168.192.*.*' : 168\.192\..*
#  - accept incoming connection from '*.in2P3.fr'  : .*\.in2p3\.fr
#  - reject incoming connection from '168.192.*.*' : -168\.192\..*
#  - reject incoming connection from '*.in2P3.fr'  : -.*\.in2p3\.fr
#
# Communication Access Control List (ACL)
# By default you can only access the server from localhost.
# This may contains several comma separated regexp
# Example
# SERVERCOMMACL=.*

#
# ACL to server status and administration
# XWHEP parts accept incoming connection to display their status and allow
# some configuration modification
# By default you can only access the server from localhost.
# Use this key to put several IP adresses separated by
# This is a regular expression (regexp)
#
# SERVERSTATACL=168.192.*.*

#
# This is the timeout is in milliseconds to pool database
#
# Default is 1000
#
#TIMEOUT=1000

#
# This is the max simultaneous incoming connections
# Default is 200

#
# This is the max simultaneous connections to DB
# Default is 60

#DBCONNECTIONS=60

#
# This is a very special case and should usually not be used
# This tells the dispatcher to avoid writing on disk, if possible. 
# Hence if server crashes, it will not be able to recover all informations

#OPTIMIZEDISK=false

#
# This contains the maximum disk space a job can use
# This is in megabytes
# Here 30 kilobytes of megabytes is 30 gigabytes
# Since 9.1.0
# Default is 30 Gb

#MAXDISKSPACE=30720

#
# This contains the maximum RAM space a job can use
# This is in kilobytes
# Here one megabytes of kilobytes is one gigabytes
# Since 9.1.0

#
# This contains class names to get time stamps for

#
# Next defines URL where launcher can find XtremWeb binary
# At startup the server checks validity: its binary and the one pointed by this URL
# must be the same
# The server cowardly refuses to start if binaries differ
# To force server start, comment or remove this variable

# This is the shceduler class name to use
# Note that if you want to be able to choose the worker for a job
