## ACTIVATORCLASS=xtremweb.worker.TCPActivator

# simple shell to set the activity mask. The activity 
# mask determine which activity are allowed, see source code
# of xtremweb.worker.activator for more details. 
# For example, TCPActivator can be used with netcat to easily control
# the worker from a shell script.
# something like
# % echo 0 | nc -q 0 localhost 10000
# will stop computation, while
# % echo 1 | nc -q localhost 10000
# will start the computaion if some jobs are available

#ACTIVATORCLASS=xtremweb.worker.CpuActivator

#
# cpuLoad aims to determine computation time accordingly to the machine CPU loads.
# It is only used with the CpuActivator activator
#
# Here's how it works :
#   If more than cpuLoad is requiered by the host for any job but the XW xorker,
#   the worker stops computing.
#   This test must be true for up to 1.5s so that the worker stops computing
#   only if the CPU seems "seriously" required by its owner
#
# Default is 50
#
#CPULOAD=50

#
# computing.jobs tells how many jobs a worker should computing and die
#
# Default is -1 : the worker will never dy
#
#COMPUTINGJOBS=-1

#
# This timeout value has a different meaning for worker and for client
#
# Worker
# ------
# This is the timeout to wait between to work requests in milliseconds
# This timeout is multiplicated by 2  between two unsuccessfull requests (work
# request returned no job) up to 4 times so that the maximum delay between
# to requests is (4 * timeout)
# Setting less than 10 is a very special case: the worker then does not
# write all files to disk. Hence if it crashes, it will not be able to
# recover all informations
#
# Client
# ------
# This is the time to wait for a each job to complete
#
# -----------------------
# This is in milliseconds
# Default is 15000
#
TIMEOUT=15000

#
# This is the socket timeout
# This is in milliseconds
# Default is 60000
# Setting it to zero means wait for ever; it is at your own risk, keep in mind that Zero may block the worker for ever
#
#SOTIMEOUT=0

#
# This defines how many times we keep trying on socket timeout
# Default is 50
# This is forced to default value, if < 1
#
#SORETRIES=1

#
# This is the max timeout to wait for a job; after this timeout the worker dies.
# This is expecially usefull to deploy workers over Grids, so that we don't use
# a machine for nothing.
# A VALUE <= 0 means wait forever
#
# This is in seconds
# Default is -1
#
#NOOPTIMEOUT=-1

#
# This contains class names to get time stamps for
# Note : substrings are allowed
# (*) "SimpleScheduler" matches "SimpleScheduler" only
#     but "Scheduler" matches "SimpleScheduler", "MatchingScheduler" etc.
# (*) "CommHandler" matches "CommHandler" only
#     but "Handler" matches "TCPHandler", "UDPHandler", "CommHandler" etc.
# (*) "xtremweb" matches all classes
# (*) etc.
#
# Default is "" (turned off)
#
#MILESTONES=xtremweb

#
# commLayer is a String determining the communication layer to use
# Possible values : 
#   - xtremweb.communications.TCPClient   (this is the default)
#   - xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient
#   - xtremweb.communications.UDPFTClient  (UDP is a very special case and should only be used with care)
#   - xtremweb.communications.XMLRPCClient (this does not work yet)
#
# Octobre 2005 :
#     UDP **ONLY** support minimalistic transfers (size < 16KB)
#     This is still a prototype :)
#     (conterpoint : if you are sure transfers are < 16KB, everything works just fine)
#     (transfers include app binary, job params etc.)
#
# Default is xtremweb.communications.TCPClient
#
#COMMLAYER=xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient

#
# commHandlers is a String determining the communication handlers
# This contains a comma separated list of colon separated tuples
#
# Example : 
#       xw:xtremweb.communications.TCPClient,http:xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient
#
# Default is xw:<commLayer value>,http:xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient
# This automatically always includes default values
# Values provided here are then added to handlers
#
# See commLayer
#
# Since June 2009, XWHEP also accepts ADICS P2P data platform by Cardiff University
# See http://www.p2p-adics.org/
#
COMMHANDLERS=attic:xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient

#
# sharedapps is a String determining the local applications the worker wants to share.
# This contains a comma separated list of application types. 
# See xtremweb.common.ApplicationType
#
# Example : 
#  SHAREDAPPS=virtualbox,vmware,vlc
#
# Default is null
#
SHAREDAPPS=docker

#
# sharedpackages is a String determining local packages
# This contains a comma separated list of packages
# The name here must be the name of the needed packages for the registered application
#
# Example : 
#  SHAREDPACKAGES=root,geant4
#
# Default is null
#
#SHAREDPACKAGES=

#
# shareddatas is a String determining local data
# This contains a comma separated list of data names
#
# Example : 
#  SHAREDDATAS=dataset1,dataset2
#
# Default is null
#
#SHAREDDATAS=

#
# shareddataspath is a String determining local paths where the worker can find data
# It must be in the same order as SHAREDDATAS
#  If set, the worker uses these paths as current working directory of works processing these data
#  If set, the worker does not send result to the XWHEP server.
#  If set, the worker does delete data processing result; it is the responsibility of the data owner.
#
# Example : 
#  SHAREDDATASPATH=/path/one,/path/two
#
#  If SHAREDDATAS=dataset1,dataset2
#  Then the worker find dataset1 content in /path/one
#  and dataset2 content in /path/two
#
# Since 10.0.0
#
# Default is null
#
#SHAREDDATASPATH=


#
# connectionLess tells to communicate in connectionless mode
# (i.e. connect, send message, disconnect)
# If set to false, we use connected communication mode
# (i.e. connect once forever at warm up, and disconnect only at shut down)
#
# This has only a sense for TCP communications
#
# Default is true
#
#CONNECTIONLESS=true

#
# multipleInstances tells whether multiple workers may run on a single host
# Allowing may overbook CPU
#
# Default is false
#
#MULTIPLEINSTANCES=false

#
# optimizeZip tells to optimze zipping process or not
# Zip optimization is quite brutal : we just don't zip if there is only 
# one tiny file to zip since zipping has a huge CPU cost
# Otherwise, if there is more than one file, or if this one but huge file
# we do zip
#
# Default is true
#
#OPTIMIZEZIP=true

#
# optimizeNetwork to try to optimize network traffic
#
# Default is true
#
#OPTIMIZENETWORK=true


#
# This contains the maximum disk space a job can use
# This is in megabytes
# Here 30 kilobytes of megabytes is 30 gigabytes
# Since 9.1.0
# Default is 30 Gb
#
#MAXDISKSPACE=30720

#
# This contains the maximum RAM space a job can use
# This is in kilobytes
# Here one megabytes of kilobytes is one gigabytes
# Since 9.1.0
# Default is 1Gb
#
#MAXRAMSPACE=1048576

#
# javaExec tells how to launch native applications; either with xtremweb.exec.Executor
# which is the default, or with standard java Runtime.exec()
# Be aware that if you use java Runtime, stdin, stdout and stderr are not managed! 
# Default is false
#
#JAVARUNTIME=false

# Use DateActivator if you want to define gaps usage for XtremWeb
# This works 'a la' crontab.
#
# OS : all
#
# This uses activator.date to define gaps.
# Several comma separated gaps may be provided.
# Be aware that defining days with no hours, defines full days (e.g. 24 hours)
# Field grammar:
# - '*'   :  every possible values
# - <x>   :  a unic value
# - <x-y> :  a couple of values separated by an hyphen ('-') defining a gap from x to y
#
# Two fields are allowed :
#   - 1st field defines days of week
#     - '*' for every day
#     - '1', 'Sun' or 'Sunday'
#     - '2', 'Mon' or 'Monday'
#     - ...
#     - '7', 'Sat' or 'Saturday'
#     - <N-M> a couple (of integers or Strings) defining days from N to M
#   - 2nd field defines hours
#     - '*'    every hour
#     - <N>    AN INTEGER DEFINING A COMPLETE HOUR (0 <= N <= 23)
#     - <N-M>  A COUPLE OF INTEGERS DEFINING HOURS FROM N:00 TO M:59 (0,0 <= N,M <= 23,23)
#
# Examples:
#   - *        *      : every days, full day
#   - *        1      : every days, from 1:00AM  to 1:59AM

#   - 1        *      : every sunday
#   - Thu      *      : every thursday
#   - 2-Thu    *      : from tuesday  to thursday
#   - 4-2      *      : from thursday to tuesday
#   - Thu-Tue  18-3   : from thursday to tuesday, from 6:00PM to 3:59AM
#   - Thu-Tue  18-3, Sat-Sun *   : from thursday to tuesday, from 6:00PM to 3:59AM
